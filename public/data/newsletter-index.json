    "description": "Puglia is what happens when coastal Italy stays grounded. It's stunning — whitewashed towns, two seas, endless olive groves — but it's also real: hot summers, slower infrastructure, and a way of life that prioritizes human connection over efficiency.

It's wildly affordable by Western European standards and still relatively undiscovered by the international retirement crowd.",
