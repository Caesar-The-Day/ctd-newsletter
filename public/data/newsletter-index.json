    "description": "Piemonte is Italy without the performance — elegant, grounded, and quietly confident. Tucked beneath the Alps, it's a region where mist rolls over vineyard hills and Barolo flows like a reward for patience. Turin sets the tone: stately cafés, Art Nouveau arcades, and a hum of intellect and history that gave Italy both its first capital and its first espresso machine. Beyond the city, you'll find medieval hill towns, truffle-scented forests, and lakes that mirror the sky so perfectly you forget which way is up. Piemonte doesn't chase attention; it earns devotion — one glass, one view, one slow afternoon at a time.",
